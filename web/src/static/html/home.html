                <p>The Walter K. Hoerning Endowment Fund offers enrichment scholarships to bright African American boys who reside in Brooklyn and attend public schools. The aim of the scholarship is to broaden and enhance the educational experiences of boys from elementary school through high school so they will be better equipped to compete for entrance to high ranking colleges. The Walter K. Hoerning Endowment Fund was established in November 1992 upon the death of Walter K. Hoerning and upon his request. Through his work in Child Welfare, he was alarmed that so many bright African American boys were not fulfilling their potential and were often being lost to street culture.</p>

                <p>He wanted to reverse this process by intervening in their lives before adolescence. He believed that by offering the opportunity to develop skills they could be better qualified applicants for college entrance and successful members of society. The boys are recommended by their public schools. They must perform in the good to excellent range. They must receive only 4s and 3s on their report cards in elementary school. They must have a minimum overall average of 80 in high school. To continue to receive scholarships they must submit report cards and letters twice a year to the Fund. They must demonstrate good attendance and active participation in their programs and attend two Fund sponsored events each year. The families must demonstrate financial inability to provide enrichment programs.</p>

                <p>They must commit to supporting their sonâ€™s attendance and participation in the enrichment programs as well as compliance with the requirements of the Fund. The Fund has sent boys to the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, The Preparatory Program for Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, The Brooklyn Music School, Juilliard, Saturday Colleges for Kids at Kingsborough Community College, Medgar Evers College, and L.I.U. as well as art programs at Pratt Institute, The School for Visual Arts, The New School, The Brooklyn Museum and Hi-Art. They have also taken test preparation courses for the Specialized High School exams and the SAT, computer classes, chess and courses at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Aquarium. The scholarship is for programs that operate during the school year. In years of fund raising success, the Fund has also sponsored boys in summer programs.</p>
